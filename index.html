        <h3>Timeline of Leftenant Adnan's Life</h3>
        <div class="timelineUL">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1915  :  </strong>Born in Sungai Ramal, Kajang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Federated Malay States, Malaya</li>
                <li><strong>1942  :  </strong>Adnan led a 42-strong platoon from the Malay Regiment to defend Singapore from the invading Japanese Imperial Army. They fought at Pasir Panjang Ridge in the Bukit Chandu ("Opium Hill") area between 12 and 14 February.[2] Despite being heavily outnumbered, Adnan refused to surrender and urged his men to fight to the end. They held off the Japanese for two days amid heavy enemy shelling from artillery and tanks, as well as chronic shortages of food, medical supplies and ammunition. On the last day of the battle, Adnan and his men were left with only a few grenades and had to fight the Japanese with their bayonets in brutal hand-to-hand combat. Adnan was shot but continued fighting. </li>
                <li><strong>1942  :  </strong>Died, at Pasir Panjang, Colony of Singapore, Straits Settlements (now Singapore)</li>
